  content: 'Sometimes making the right choice is easy even when the decision is hard.Polymath
    has brought on some senior leadership in the last few months to help make the
    company more operational. That''s a rarity in the blockchain space. Hiring a CMO
    was part of that decision, and there are other senior leaders they''ve added on
    as well. Last week on Monday, another leader came on board.By Tuesday, he''d told
    me that it was his opinion that having me work at Polymath 3 days a week in the
    office and 2 days a week from Montreal was untenable. He said that it was nothing
    personal; he never would have allowed my hiring to go through if he''d been involved.
    Wednesday he made it very clear: come work 5 days a week in Toronto or leave.This
    had nothing to do with performance. I''d only been at the company for 5 weeks,
    and in that time I''d defined the brand proposition, created a company KPIs dashboard
    from scratch, built and refined a company-wide budget from scratch, led the creation
    of 3 new websites, coordinated a successful 5 city pan-Asia tour for the CEO,
    identified excellent candidates for 3 key marketing roles, implemented a new CRM
    and deal flow for the whole revenue team, and prepared a revenue team weekly and
    monthly roadmap for Q4 2018. Those accomplishments weren''t any part of the equation;
    my presence at the office was the sole issue.Polymath has nearly half of its staff
    working remotely, so it had honestly never crossed my mind it would be a problem.
    My family is in Montreal. I am not willing to spend the week away from my wife
    and son and only see them 2 days a week. It''s why, when I joined Polymath, I
    got approval for my schedule and how I would work both in office and remotely
    before accepting their offer. That it was suddenly unacceptable was both shocking
    and disappointing.Regardless, the ultimatum was clear. On Wednesday, I resigned
    from Polymath. I believe in the company, in the team that Trevor Koverko and Chris
    Houser are putting together, and I believe that the financial industry needs exactly
    the kind of product that Polymath is developing. Sadly, Polymath will need to
    do it without me.The right choice was easy: I will always put my family first.
    I''m no stranger to the 50- or 60-hour week, but I arrange that schedule around
    my family life. I wake up at 5 before my family is up; I put in an hour or two
    in the evening or over the weekends. I don''t sacrifice whole weeks of time from
    my family. I knew as I was talking with the leadership team at Polymath that I''d
    never bend on that principle. So result of the decision is hard because I didn''t
    want to go. But the choice of it was easy. Today on Canadian Thanksgiving, it''s
    a good day to think about the fact that family matters, and how choices that involve
    your family can impact what we do. So I''m back on the job market. I don''t regret
    my choice, but I do need to deal with the outcomes from it. If you know anyone
    looking for a Montreal-based or remote CMO / CEO who knows the SaaS / startup
    space like the back of his hand, who''s built products from the ground up, who''s
    launched a dozen companies to market, and who knows how to secure funding and
    how find a path to revenue, please pass my name around. :)'

  headline: Content that you'd like
  content: 'Hi, there!You''re looking who has a deep knowledge of online and offline
    marketing, can speak with authority and clarity to all levels of a company, and
    for a leader who can identify and nurture talent. I''m looking for a new opportunity
    to put my leadership and marketing skills to work after I help my current company
    ship their tentpole product for 2016. It sounds like we could be great together.
    Who am I?My resume or LinkedIn profile will tell you the details, but let me give
    you the broad view: I''m a data-driven leader and marketer who''s primarily worked
    as VP or head of marketing for tech companies for the last 8 years, running both
    B2B and B2C marketing &amp; PR campaigns which have had direct, measurable impact
    on the bottom line.  So why am I looking to leave?I''ve been living and working
    in Poland for the last 5 years. My wife, who''s been very patient about this trip
    abroad that was going to be 1 year, and then 2, and has now stretched on longer
    than either of us thought, is increasingly insistent about moving somewhere she
    can pursue her studies further, and I feel it''s only fair that I do so. There''s
    a major product launch my company is going to kick off in July, and after then
    I feel that I can leave in good conscience, with the company in a good position
    to succeed in 2016 and 2017, and my wife will refrain from poisoning my soup.
    Everyone wins!Why do I care about this opportunity?I''ve built and led teams ranging
    from 3 to 37, and managed budgets from $1,000 a month to over a million a year.
    I''ve got enough experience and vision to start taking on senior roles in more
    audacious capacities, and there are very few companies where I can work with the
    best in the profession, continue to learn, and help influence a company''s trajectory.
    As someone who''s extremely familiar with all kinds of online and offline marketing,
    I believe that this is a fantastic role for me to move to, and I''d love to be
    a part of it.Why should you care about me?When''s the last time you had a leader
    bring your whole office to their feet because he showed them clearly how important
    they are to making the company succeed (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/y7vyslzjig5yjuf/Kontakt.mp4?dl=0"

    When is the last time a senior leader broke out Tableau, spotted a worrying trend
    in your financial data, and spent a week brainstorming with your technical and
    leadership teams to fix it in one month instead of 6? How often have you had a
    senior leader who built an entire company''s processes from scratch around OKRs
    and Kanban, from marketing to sales to R&amp;D? I''ve done all of these things;
    I am a clear communicator, a strong leader, and a powerful speaker. If you''re
    looking for someone who can lead an international team and coach them to deliver
    fantastic marketing and events, I believe I''m that guy.I''d love to talk further
    with you about this opportunity, what I can do for you, and answer any questions
    you may have. Drop me a note and let''s schedule a call. :)'
